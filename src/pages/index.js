        All cases are either being transferred to a new law firm, being returned
        to the creditor, or our client. New counsel is in the process of
        substituting in as attorney of record in pending Court cases. Written
        notification of the transfer pending Court cases and payment
        arrangements, where applicable, are in the process of being mailed out.
        If this is an urgent matter you may contact the creditor directly. If
        you have an account with LVNV or Resurgent, please call them directly at
        (888) 665-0374. Thank you for your patience through this transition.
